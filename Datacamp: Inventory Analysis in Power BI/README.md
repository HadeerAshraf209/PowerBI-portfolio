# 📦 Inventory Analysis in Power BI  
### Case Study – WarmeHands Inc.

---

## Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end inventory analysis built in Power BI, based on a real-world business scenario from a guided DataCamp case study.
The objective is to support inventory optimization and purchasing decisions by transforming raw sales and inventory data into actionable management insights through data cleaning, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboards.
The analysis is conducted for a fictitious retail company, **WarmeHands Inc.**, facing common inventory management challenges such as inefficient stock allocation and unclear product performance.
